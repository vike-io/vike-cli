name: vike-token-holders
description: Top holders of an ERC-20 token by cumulative net inflow USD, with known labels. Use when the user asks "top holders of X" / "who holds the most of token Y" / "is whale Z holding token A".
allowed-tools: Bash(vike:*)

# vike-token-holders

## Command

```bash
vike token holders <token_address> [--chain ethereum|bsc|base] [--limit N] [--json]
```

## Examples

```bash
# Resolve symbol first if needed:
vike token search PEPE --chain ethereum --limit 1 --json
# Then holders:
vike token holders 0x6982508145454ce325ddbe47a25d4ec3d2311933 --limit 20
```

## Output columns

`wallet`, `net_flow_usd` (lifetime), `volume_usd` (lifetime), `tx_count`, `first_seen`, `last_active`, `entity`, `wallet_type`

## Reading

- **Sorted descending by `net_flow_usd`** — the biggest accumulators are at the top
- A row with `entity = "Binance"` is a CEX hot/cold wallet — these aggregate millions of retail holders, not single discretionary positions
- `first_seen` earlier than the token's launch month = wallet was active before this token existed; probably an aggregator
- Two wallets with similar `net_flow_usd` but very different `tx_count`: low-tx = single buy-and-hold; high-tx = active trader

## Anti-patterns

- "Top holders" here means cumulative net inflow over all time — NOT current on-chain balance (which would require querying the contract directly). A wallet that bought $10M and sold $9M shows `net_flow_usd = $1M`, even if current balance is zero. **Always call this out** when reporting top holders.
- Don't list `tx_count = 1` whales as "smart money" without context — could be an airdrop receiver who never sold.
- For BSC tokens, pass `--chain bsc` explicitly; default is ethereum.

## Pairs well with

- `vike labels <addr>` — drill into any holder's full label cascade
- `vike token transfers <addr>` — see who's currently buying/selling in last 24h
- `vike wallet summary <addr>` — full activity profile of any holder
