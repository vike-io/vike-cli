# vike-wallet-counterparties

## Command

```bash
vike wallet counterparties <address>
  [--chain ethereum|bsc|base]
  [--window 24h|7d|30d|90d|180d|all]
  [--limit N]   (max 50)
  [--json]
```

## Example

```bash
vike wallet counterparties 0xd8da6bf26964af9d7eed9e03e53415d37aa96045 --window 30d
```

## Output columns

`wallet`, `total_volume_usd`, `sent_usd`, `received_usd`, `tx_count`, `first_seen`, `last_seen`, `entity`, `wallet_type`

## Reading

- **Sent + Received roughly equal** = active trading partner (DEX router, MM, regular counterparty)
- **Sent >> Received** = wallet pays this counterparty (deposit address, contract call)
- **Received >> Sent** = wallet receives from this counterparty (funding source, employer, airdrop)
- `entity = "Binance"` (CEX) on the top row = the wallet deposits to / withdraws from that exchange
- `wallet_type = "dex"` = router contracts (Uniswap, 1inch, Curve routers) — typical for active traders
- Unlabeled top counterparty with high volume = potentially related wallet worth investigating with `vike labels`

## Anti-patterns

- Don't claim two wallets are "controlled by the same person" from counterparties alone — many people deposit to the same Binance address. Pair with `vike-wallet-clustering` (deferred) or manual investigation.
- Window matters: a 24h view captures recent activity but misses long-standing relationships. Default to 30d, expand to `all` for full history.
- For tokens with high churn (memecoins), top counterparties will be dominated by Uniswap routers; filter mentally for non-DEX rows for human counterparties.

## Pairs well with

- `vike labels <addr>` — drill into any interesting counterparty's full label cascade
- `vike wallet summary <addr>` — total activity of any counterparty
- `vike wallet balances <addr>` — see what tokens that counterparty currently holds
